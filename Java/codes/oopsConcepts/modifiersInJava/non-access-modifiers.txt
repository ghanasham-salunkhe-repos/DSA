Here are brief examples for each non-access modifier in Java:

**synchronized**
Ensures only one thread can execute the method at a time.
```java
public synchronized void increment() {
    count++;
}
```

**volatile**
Ensures changes to the variable are visible to all threads.
```java
private volatile boolean running = true;
```

**transient**
Prevents a field from being serialized.
```java
private transient String password;
```

**native**
Declares a method implemented in native code (e.g., C/C++).
```java
public native void nativeMethod();
```

**strictfp**
Ensures floating-point calculations are consistent across platforms.
```java
public strictfp class StrictFPExample {
    public strictfp double calculate(double a, double b) {
        return a / b;
    }
}
```
