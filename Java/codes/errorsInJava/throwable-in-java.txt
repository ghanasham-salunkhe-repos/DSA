A `Throwable` in Java is the superclass for all errors and exceptions that can be thrown by the JVM. It is part of the `java.lang`
package and serves as the root of Java’s exception handling mechanism.

**Significance:**
- All objects that can be thrown using the `throw` statement must inherit from `Throwable`.
- It has two main subclasses: `Exception` (for recoverable conditions) and `Error` (for serious, unrecoverable problems).
- Enables structured error and exception handling, allowing programs to catch, handle, or propagate issues during execution.

**Hierarchy:**
```
java.lang.Object
   └── java.lang.Throwable
         ├── java.lang.Exception
         │      └── java.lang.RuntimeException
         └── java.lang.Error
```

**Example:**
```java
try {
    throw new Exception("This is an exception");
} catch (Throwable t) {
    System.out.println("Caught: " + t.getMessage());
}
```
This allows handling any object that is a subclass of `Throwable`, providing a unified approach to error and exception management.
