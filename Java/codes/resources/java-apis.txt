"Inbuilt Java classes" are often called the "Java API" because API stands for Application Programming Interface.
The Java API is a large collection of prewritten classes, interfaces, and packages provided by Java, which developers use to build applications.
 These classes define how you interact with the Java platformâ€”offering ready-made functionality for tasks like data structures, file I/O, networking, and more.

Why?
    - The Java API acts as an interface between your code and the Java platform.
    - It standardizes how you use built-in features, making development faster and more reliable.
    - "API" emphasizes that you use these classes through their public methods, not by modifying their internal code.
    - Example:
        Classes like java.util.ArrayList, java.io.File, and java.lang.String are all part of the Java API
