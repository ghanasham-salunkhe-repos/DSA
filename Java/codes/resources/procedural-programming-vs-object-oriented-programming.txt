### Differences Between Procedural Programming and Object-Oriented Programming (With Examples and Analogies):

1. **Programming Paradigm**:
   - **Procedural Programming**: Think of procedural programming as following a recipe. You have a set of instructions (functions) that operate on ingredients (data).
    For example:
     ```c
     // Procedural example in C
     int add(int a, int b) {
         return a + b;
     }

     int main() {
         int result = add(5, 3);
         printf("Result: %d", result);
         return 0;
     }
     ```
     Here, the function `add` operates on external data (`a` and `b`).

   - **Object-Oriented Programming**: Imagine OOP as designing a blueprint for a car. The car (object) has both attributes (color, model) and behaviors (drive, stop).
    For example:
     ```java
     // OOP example in Java
     class Car {
         String color;
         String model;

         Car(String color, String model) {
             this.color = color;
             this.model = model;
         }

         void drive() {
             System.out.println("The " + color + " " + model + " is driving.");
         }
     }

     public class Main {
         public static void main(String[] args) {
             Car car = new Car("Red", "Tesla");
             car.drive();
         }
     }
     ```
     Here, the `Car` class encapsulates both data (`color`, `model`) and behavior (`drive`).

2. **Structure**:
   - **Procedural Programming**: Code is organized into functions. For example, in a library system,
    you might have separate functions for adding books, issuing books, and returning books:
     ```c
     void addBook() { /* logic */ }
     void issueBook() { /* logic */ }
     void returnBook() { /* logic */ }
     ```
     Functions are independent and operate on shared data.

   - **OOP**: Code is organized into classes and objects. In the same library system, you might have a `Book` class with attributes and methods:
     ```java
     class Book {
         String title;
         String author;

         void issue() { /* logic */ }
         void returnBook() { /* logic */ }
     }
     ```
     The `Book` class bundles data and behavior together.

3. **Data Handling**:
   - **Procedural Programming**: Data is separate from functions. Functions manipulate external data. Analogy: A chef (function) works on ingredients (data) provided to them.
     ```c
     int data = 10;
     void processData() {
         data += 5;
     }
     ```

   - **OOP**: Data and functions are bundled together in objects. Analogy: A vending machine (object) has both the snacks (data) and the ability to dispense them (behavior).
     ```java
     class VendingMachine {
         int snacks = 10;

         void dispenseSnack() {
             snacks--;
         }
     }
     ```

---

4. **Reusability**:
   - **Procedural Programming**: Reusability is limited. You often copy and modify code. Analogy: Writing a new recipe every time you cook a dish.
     ```c
     void add(int a, int b) { /* logic */ }
     void subtract(int a, int b) { /* logic */ }
     ```

   - **OOP**: Promotes reusability through inheritance and polymorphism. Analogy: A car manufacturer reuses the same engine design across multiple car models.
     ```java
     class Vehicle {
         void start() { System.out.println("Vehicle started"); }
     }

     class Car extends Vehicle {
         void start() { System.out.println("Car started"); }
     }
     ```

---

5. **Scalability**:
   - **Procedural Programming**: Less scalable for large applications. Analogy: Managing a large group of people without assigning roles.
     ```c
     void processData() { /* logic */ }
     void handleData() { /* logic */ }
     ```

   - **OOP**: More scalable due to modular design. Analogy: A company with departments (objects) handling specific tasks.
     ```java
     class Department {
         void handleTask() { /* logic */ }
     }
     ```

---

6. **Examples**:
   - **Procedural Programming**: Languages like C and Pascal focus on functions and procedures.
   - **OOP**: Languages like Java, Python, and C++ focus on classes and objects.

### Analogy Summary:
- **Procedural Programming**: Like following a recipe where instructions (functions) operate on ingredients (data).
- **OOP**: Like designing a blueprint for a car where the car (object) has both attributes (data) and behaviors (functions).
