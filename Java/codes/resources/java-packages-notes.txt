Packages in Java are a way to organize related classes and interfaces into namespaces, similar to folders or directories in a file system. They help manage large codebases by grouping similar functionality together, avoiding naming conflicts, and improving code maintainability.

**Analogy:**
Think of packages like folders on your computer. Just as you might store all your photos in a "Pictures" folder and documents in a "Documents" folder, in Java, you store related classes in the same package. For example, all classes related to user authentication might go in a `security` package.

**Example:**
- `java.util` package contains utility classes like `ArrayList`, `HashMap`, etc.
- `java.io` package contains classes for input and output, like `File`, `InputStream`, etc.

**Custom Package Example:**
Suppose you are building an e-commerce application:
- `com.shop.product` for product-related classes
- `com.shop.order` for order management
- `com.shop.user` for user accounts

**Benefits:**
- **Organization:** Keeps code modular and easy to navigate.
- **Access Control:** Classes in a package can have package-private access, restricting visibility.
- **Avoids Name Clashes:** Two classes with the same name can exist in different packages.

**Usage Example:**
```java
package com.shop.product;

public class Product {
    // Product details
}
```
To use this class elsewhere:
```java
import com.shop.product.Product;
```

Packages are fundamental for structuring Java projects, just like shelves in a library help organize books by category.
